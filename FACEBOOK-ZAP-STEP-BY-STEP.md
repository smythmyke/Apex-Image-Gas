```

## Common Issues:

**Can't find Webhooks?**
- Make sure you're searching in the TRIGGER section, not action
- Type "webhook" not "webhooks"

**Facebook not connecting?**
- Make sure you're logged in as a page admin
- Try using a different browser
- Clear cookies and try again

**Don't see your page?**
- Make sure you selected "Facebook Pages" not regular Facebook
- Ensure you have admin access to the page

Once you have your webhook URL, share it with me and we'll test posting to Facebook!
