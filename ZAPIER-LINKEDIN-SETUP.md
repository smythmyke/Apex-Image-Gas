3. Your webhook is now live!

## Step 5: Save Your Webhook URL

Run this command in your Apex Gas project:
```bash
cd /home/mykemet/Desktop/Projects/Apex_gas
node scripts/update-linkedin-credentials.js
```

Enter your webhook URL when prompted:
```
https://hooks.zapier.com/hooks/catch/YOUR_ID/YOUR_KEY/
```

## What Your Webhook Accepts

Your blog automation will send data like this:
```json
{
  "commentary": "Blog post title and excerpt with hashtags",
  "visibility": "PUBLIC",
  "link_url": "https://apeximagegas.net/blog/post-slug",
  "link_title": "Blog Post Title",
  "link_description": "Brief description of the blog post",
  "image_url": "https://images.pexels.com/..."
}
```

## Testing Your Integration

After setup, test with this Node.js script:

```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

const webhookUrl = 'YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL_HERE';
const testPost = {
  commentary: "üß™ Testing Apex Gas LinkedIn integration! Learn about the importance of precision gas mixtures in medical X-ray imaging. #MedicalImaging #XrayTechnology",
  visibility: "PUBLIC",
  link_url: "https://apeximagegas.net",
  link_title: "Apex Image Gas - Premium X-Ray Detector Gas",
  link_description: "Specialized gas solutions for EOS X-ray machines"
};

axios.post(webhookUrl, testPost)
  .then(() => console.log('‚úÖ Post sent successfully!'))
  .catch(err => console.error('‚ùå Error:', err.message));
```

## Troubleshooting

### Webhook not receiving data?
- Ensure you're on a paid Zapier plan
- Check the webhook URL is correct
- Verify Content-Type is "application/json"

### LinkedIn post not appearing?
- Check you selected the right company page
- Ensure you have admin access to the page
- Verify the post content meets LinkedIn's requirements

### Need to find your webhook URL again?
1. Go to your Zaps
2. Click on "Apex Gas Blog to LinkedIn"
3. Click on the trigger step
4. Your webhook URL is displayed there

## Next Steps

Once your webhook is working:
1. The blog automation will automatically post to LinkedIn
2. Posts will include relevant hashtags
3. Each blog post will link back to your website
4. Analytics will track engagement

**Need help?** The most common issue is forgetting to upgrade to a paid Zapier plan. Webhooks require at least the Professional plan.
