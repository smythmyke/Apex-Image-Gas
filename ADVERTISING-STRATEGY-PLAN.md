## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### LinkedIn Mistakes
```
❌ Don't:
├── Target too broad (wastes budget on irrelevant clicks)
├── Use generic stock photos (looks unprofessional)
├── Send InMail too soon (build rapport first)
├── Ignore LinkedIn recommendations (they know their platform)
└── Forget to A/B test (always test variations)

✅ Do:
├── Target specific job titles
├── Use custom photography
├── Warm up audience before InMail
├── Follow platform best practices
└── Continuously test and optimize
```

### Google Ads Mistakes
```
❌ Don't:
├── Use broad match keywords (too much waste)
├── Forget negative keywords (filter irrelevant searches)
├── Ignore Quality Score (affects costs)
├── Send all traffic to homepage (use specific landing pages)
└── Set-and-forget campaigns (requires ongoing optimization)

✅ Do:
├── Start with exact/phrase match
├── Build robust negative keyword list
├── Improve ad relevance for Quality Score
├── Create dedicated landing pages
└── Review and optimize weekly
```

### Facebook Mistakes
```
❌ Don't:
├── Expect B2B performance like LinkedIn
├── Target too broadly (use all available targeting)
├── Use low-quality images (Facebook is visual)
├── Forget mobile optimization (90%+ mobile traffic)
└── Boost posts randomly (use Ads Manager)

✅ Do:
├── Focus on remarketing/lookalikes
├── Layer multiple targeting criteria
├── Use high-quality visuals
├── Optimize for mobile experience
└── Use structured campaigns in Ads Manager
```
