# Verify Your Phone Number with Twilio

Since you're on a Twilio trial account, you need to verify your phone number before receiving SMS messages.

## Quick Steps:

1. **Go to the verification page:**
   https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/verified

2. **Add your number:**
   - Enter: +12144003781
   - Click "Verify"
   
3. **Complete verification:**
   - Choose SMS or Call
   - Enter the code you receive
   - Click "Submit"

## Alternative: Upgrade Account
If you upgrade from trial to paid account, you can send to any number without verification.

## Once Verified:
Your SMS notifications will work immediately for:
- New orders ($9,999 purchase or subscription)
- Form submissions
- Test messages

The system is fully configured and ready - just needs your number verified!
